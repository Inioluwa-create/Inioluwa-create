## About ME 👱🏾‍♂️

I'm Inioluwa Jacob, a budding cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in product design. <br/>

Currently, I'm diving deep into the world of cybersecurity as a student, learning the ropes and sharpening my skills day by day. Before this transitioning, I was a product designer for two years, where I collaborated with companies in the consulting and health sectors to create impactful digital experiences. <br/>

I have basic knowledge in core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I grow in tech, I'm learning to think in terms of vulnerabilities, threat modeling, and ethical hacking—core ideas in the cybersecurity space. My design background also brings in user experience, and design thinking into my vocabulary. <br/>

Beyond the screen, I love exploring new technologies, scripting short films, and getting behind the camera to shoot and direct them. I’m also a big football fan <br/>
