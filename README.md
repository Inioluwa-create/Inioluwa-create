## Hey there! 👋 I'm Inioluwa Jacob

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in product design, currently focusing on Security Operations Center (SOC) fundamentals and network security.

🔭 What I'm up to:
I'm diving deep into the world of cybersecurity as a student, learning to monitor, detect, and respond to security threats. My journey involves understanding network protocols, analyzing security events, and building the foundational skills needed for SOC operations.

🛠️ My Background:
Before transitioning into security, I spent two years as a product designer, collaborating with companies in the consulting and health sectors to create impactful digital experiences. This background gives me a unique perspective. I approach security not just from a technical angle, but with an eye for user experience and design thinking.

📚 Technical Foundation:

Networking: Understanding network architectures, protocols (TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP/HTTPS), and how data flows through modern systems

SOC Skills: Security monitoring, log analysis, incident detection, and understanding SIEM tools

Core Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—because understanding how applications are built helps in understanding how they can be secured

🎯 Current Focus:
I'm learning to think like a defender analyzing network traffic, identifying anomalies, and understanding threat landscapes. My design background continues to influence how I approach problems: breaking down complex security concepts into understandable pieces and always considering the human element in security.

⚡ Beyond Tech:
When I'm not analyzing logs or studying network packets, you'll find me exploring new technologies, scripting short films, or behind the camera shooting and directing. I'm also a huge football fan because everyone needs a break from the screen sometimes!
